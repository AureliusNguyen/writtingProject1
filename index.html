        <h1>Bridging Cultures: My Evolution from Vietnamese Prose to International Writing
        </h1>
        <p>
            As a Vietnamese immigrant who came to the United States later in life, I brought with me a unique approach to language and writing in addition to my cultural heritage. My earliest writing experiences were influenced by Vietnamese culture, where the use of flowery language and description was highly regarded. Vietnamese literature frequently prioritized "telling" over "showing," favoring the richness of descriptive words above the meticulous depiction of situations and emotional thoughts. This original method of writing had a big influence on how I first tried to write in English, especially when I had to write my Common Application essay.</p>
        <p>
            If I wanted to enter the American educational system, my literary adaptations needed to change. I need to change from writing only a line “The flower is very beautiful. ” to “The flower has pink petals which look like a stick of cotton candy. When the sun shines, it gives off its sweet vanilla scent to anyone passing by. ” As you can see, the latter shows much more emotion and allows the reader to deeply immerse in the story. I had to properly communicate my experiences, identities, and objectives in the Common App essay, a crucial part of college applications. It required the capacity to captivate readers emotionally and intellectually in addition to having a cogent story. My initial draft written in the Vietnamese style did an amazing job in explaining what quantum physics is, but failed to demonstrate how important the role it plays in my life.</p>

            When I was trying to write the Common App essay, it unintentionally changed into a scientific story, where I used dry, poetic language instead of adding more emotions to it. That’s because when I first started writing in Vietnam, I mostly used flowery language just for the sake of following my teachers’ instructions, making it lack personal and emotional attributes. That means I prioritize to describe the topic but exclude myself, and my relations to the topic. Things got even worse when I started to write lengthy, 10-page essays in Vietnamese about scientific subjects. The accurate exposition of scientific notions took precedence over feelings of emotion and individual expression. As I dug more into these technical texts, I grew more attracted to the methodical, analytical quality of this approach.</p>
        <p>
            I dove into a lengthy and somewhat technical explanation of quantum physics in the early drafts of my Common App essay, concentrating in particular on the paradoxical property of light that it may exist as both a wave and a particle. My work seemed to become a technical discourse, resembling the scientific writing I had done in high school. I received a lot of criticism from my teacher on my Common App essay when I was drafting it. The criticism was really helpful in making me realize that my article lacked sufficient personalization and emotion. It helped me realize that personal storytelling's power was central to the Common App essay.</p>

            After receiving my teacher’s feedback, I made considerable revisions to my essay to address this. I studied the craft of storytelling by reading books on narrative writing. I enhanced the content with personal information, anecdotes, and experiences that helped me establish a stronger connection with the reader to convey my enthusiasm for quantum physics. This improvement not only made my essay more interesting but also allowed it to present the person I am more accurately.</p>
        <p>
            This encounter was a turning point in my writing career. It emphasized the significance of achieving the ideal balance between expressing one's passions and abiding by the requirements of the writing conventions. It brought home the necessity of changing my writing style to suit the essay's audience and goal. I developed a more well-rounded and effective writing style by fusing sensory descriptions, stories, and vivid details to produce a response that connected with others. From writing “quantum physics possess some of the most interesting phenomena of the universe”, I changed it to “The subject of duality is what always makes my mind-boggling: How can one thing be two things at the same time? How can light be seen but untouchable?”. As you can see, rather than stating a fact, I was able to convey the depth of my interest in the subject in a way that my old writing style could never afford.</p>

            This change in my writing style has implications that go beyond the context of academic essays. It illustrates the overarching topic of adaptation and cultural fusion. I came to understand that embracing the subtleties of various languages and writing traditions could act as a link between my American identity and my Vietnamese ancestry. This evolution of my writing also represents the process of my acculturation, during which I figured out how to negotiate the challenges of being a part of two different cultures. This event also emphasized the need to understand the benefits and drawbacks of various writing styles and know when and how to apply them.</p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, it has been a transformative experience for me to move from writing in a Vietnamese style that emphasizes dry terminologies and lacks personal aspects to adopting a more articulated and disciplined approach in American academic writing. In addition to assisting me in completing my college applications successfully, it expanded my knowledge of how language and culture affect our identities. This experience emphasizes the value of flexibility and self-awareness and underlines the opportunity to meld cultural traditions to forge a distinctive and influential voice in the writing world.</p>
